**Introduction to Smart Cities** - *Casta Zhu*

A brief introduction to smart cities and the applications of digital twins.

**Introduction to Character Design** - *Diganta Ghorai*

 We designed characters based on 3 design constraints -

1) A present hobby

2) A favorite animal (real/fictional)

3) A future goal/plan

**Bridging The Gap** - *Casta Zhu*

We built unique bridges and tested to see if it could withstand the weight of several books.

**Introduction to Game Design** - *Diganta Ghorai*

Using the character designs from the previous week, we created a player vs player card battle game where each character had specific character moves with attack/defense/health/special attack point constraints.

**Tactile and Accessible Wayfinding Apps in Cities** - *Nihal Erkan*

Demonstration of using accessible apps to provide assistance to the user for navigation in the city.

**Field Trip** - *The High Line*

Students went on a field trip to the High Line and tested several accessibile navigation apps.

**Intro to 3D Modeling** - *Diganta Ghorai*

The students were introduced how to use Blender - an open source 3D modeling software for modeling a car, texturing it, lighting it and finally rendering it.

**Tinkercad Workshop** - *Adele Loye*

Adele led a workshop on Tinkercad, which is a free web app for 3D design, electronics, and coding. We're the ideal introduction to Autodesk, a global leader in design and make technology.

**Field Trip** - *Ford Foundation*

The Ford Foundation is located in New York City at the Center for Social Justice.

**Clay Modeling** - *Casta Zhu & Diganta Ghorai*

Making 3D clay models of the character designs students made in the first week.
